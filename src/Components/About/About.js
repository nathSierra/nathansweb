    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>My name is Nathan Sierra.</p>
    <p>I currently live in Atlanta,</p>
    <p>but I used to live in Illinois, Montana, and even the Czech Republic (for a bit!).</p>
    <p>I've been studying computer science on my own for around a year, and I'm currently in the Atlanta Web Development 2019 spring cohort.</p>
    <p>Before that I let my love of literature dictate my schooling.</p>
    <p>As a kid, I let my mind become absorbed by worlds crafted by excellent storytellers. To me, stories almost seemed like magic.</p>
    <p>Today I'm enthralled by computer science. </p>
    <p>It's a discipline that feels almost like you're practicing magic.</p>
    <p>I'm consistently amazed by the world around me, by the ingenuity and kindness of humanity and the beauty of nature. </p>
    <p>I hope to continue to become a great web developer, and someday perhaps even a software developer.</p>

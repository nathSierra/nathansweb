    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>My name is Nathan Sierra.</p>
    <p>I currently live in Atlanta,</p>
    <p>but I used to live in Illinois, Montana, and even the Czech Republic (for a bit!).</p>
    <p>I've been studying computer science on my own for around a year, and I've recently graduated from Georgia Tech's 2019 Full Stack Flex Web Development program.</p>
    <p>Before that I let my love of literature dictate my schooling, and graduated from Southern Illinois University Edwardsville with a BA in English Literature.</p>
    <p>As a kid, I let my mind become absorbed by worlds crafted by excellent storytellers. To me, stories almost seemed like magic. The fact one could weave mere thoughts into conveying a grand epic like Lord of the Rings astounded me.</p>
    <p>Today, that I'm similarly enthralled by computer science; the art and science of constructing an idea into a functional piece of software is, without being too over-the-top, astounding. </p>
    <p>It's almost as though you're practicing magic.</p>
    <p>I'm consistently amazed by the world around me, by the ingenuity and kindness of humanity and the beauty of nature. </p>
    <p>I hope to continue to become a great web developer, and someday perhaps even a software developer.</p>
